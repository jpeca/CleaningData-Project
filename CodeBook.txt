DATA DICTONARY - Result Data set
--------------------------------

This data set contains average of accelerometer data collected from the Samsung Galaxy S smart-phone by subject and activity. Columns are separated by space.

prefix 't' in column name indicate time domain signal
prefix 'f' in column name indicate frequency domain signals
suffix '-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

Id  columns:
subject	
	ordinal number  of subject in data set
activity	
	Activities from following list:
		WALKING
		WALKING_UPSTAIRS
		WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
		SITTING 
		STANDING
		LAYING

All subsequent columns are average value by subject and activity.
